Based on comprehensive system analysis, we aim to elevate the platform from 85% to 98% enterprise-grade architecture compliance through systematic improvements in code quality, architectural patterns, and operational excellence.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis architecture optimization directly supports the IOE-DREAM product vision of providing a high-performance, secure, and scalable enterprise campus management solution. The improvements will enhance system reliability, developer productivity, and maintainability while ensuring strict compliance with Jakarta EE 9+ standards and SmartAdmin v3 architectural patterns.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Compilation Error Elimination\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a development team, I want a zero-compilation-error codebase, so that we can deploy with confidence and eliminate technical debt blocking development velocity.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the compilation process runs THEN the system SHALL report 0 compilation errors\r\n2. IF any javax package references exist THEN the system SHALL automatically convert them to jakarta equivalents\r\n3. WHEN @Autowired annotations are detected THEN they SHALL be replaced with @Resource annotations\r\n4. WHEN entity classes lack BaseEntity inheritance THEN they SHALL extend BaseEntity properly\r\n5. IF method signatures don't match interface contracts THEN they SHALL be corrected to maintain compilation integrity\r\n6. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN they SHALL be resolved through proper dependency injection\r\n7. WHEN missing imports prevent compilation THEN they SHALL be automatically added or resolved\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: BaseService Abstraction Layer Implementation\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified BaseService abstraction for CRUD operations, so that I can reduce code duplication and maintain consistent data access patterns across all modules.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN a new service needs CRUD operations THEN it SHALL extend BaseService<T, ID>\r\n2. IF common CRUD methods are required THEN BaseService SHALL provide generic implementations\r\n3. WHEN business-specific logic is needed THEN the service SHALL override base methods appropriately\r\n4. IF database operations fail THEN BaseService SHALL provide consistent exception handling\r\n5. WHEN caching is required THEN BaseService SHALL integrate with the unified cache architecture\r\n6. IF validation is needed THEN BaseService SHALL provide consistent parameter validation\r\n7. WHEN auditing is required THEN BaseService SHALL automatically handle audit fields\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Consume Module Completion\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a campus administrator, I want complete consumption management functionality, so that I can manage all financial transactions, generate comprehensive reports, and ensure data consistency across the system.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN accessing consumption reports THEN the system SHALL provide all 28 report types\r\n2. IF advanced analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL generate trend analysis and forecasting reports\r\n3. WHEN data consistency checks run THEN the system SHALL validate all transaction integrity\r\n4. IF reconciliation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated reconciliation capabilities\r\n5. WHEN performance monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL track all consumption metrics\r\n6. IF audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain complete transaction histories\r\n7. WHEN real-time monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide live consumption dashboards\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Frontend Permission Control Enhancement\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive frontend permission control, so that all UI elements properly respect the RBAC authorization model and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive features.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN a Vue component renders THEN it SHALL implement v-permission directives for all sensitive actions\r\n2. IF a user lacks permission THEN the corresponding UI elements SHALL be hidden or disabled\r\n3. WHEN permission checks occur THEN they SHALL validate against the backend RBAC model\r\n4. IF permissions are updated THEN the frontend SHALL dynamically adjust UI access accordingly\r\n5. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper authorization headers\r\n6. IF permission validation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate access denied messages\r\n7. WHEN admin users manage permissions THEN they SHALL see all available permission options\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5: Unified Exception Handling System\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system user, I want consistent and meaningful error messages, so that I can understand issues and take appropriate action without encountering technical jargon or system failures.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN an exception occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with complete context\r\n2. IF a business exception is thrown THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message\r\n3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific field-level error guidance\r\n4. IF a system error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a generic error message with reference code\r\n5. WHEN security violations happen THEN the system SHALL log security events and return appropriate messages\r\n6. IF database errors occur THEN the system shall handle them gracefully without exposing technical details\r\n7. WHEN external service failures happen THEN the system shall provide fallback options or retry mechanisms\r\n\r\n### Requirement 6: Repository Layer Standardization\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want standardized repository patterns across all modules, so that I can maintain consistent data access patterns and leverage complex query capabilities efficiently.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN complex queries are needed THEN repositories SHALL provide optimized query methods\r\n2. IF database operations are performed THEN repositories SHALL handle connection management properly\r\n3. WHEN pagination is required THEN repositories SHALL implement consistent pagination patterns\r\n4. IF caching is beneficial THEN repositories SHALL integrate with the multi-level cache system\r\n5. WHEN data relationships are complex THEN repositories SHALL provide relationship resolution methods\r\n6. IF performance issues are detected THEN repositories SHALL support query optimization techniques\r\n7. WHEN database transactions are involved THEN repositories SHALL participate properly in transaction management\r\n\r\n### Requirement 7: Test Coverage Enhancement\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage across all layers, so that I can ensure system reliability and prevent regressions during development and deployment.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN code is committed THEN unit tests SHALL cover at least 80% of business logic\r\n2. IF services are developed THEN they SHALL have comprehensive integration test coverage\r\n3. WHEN APIs are implemented THEN they SHALL have complete endpoint testing\r\n4. IF critical business flows exist THEN they SHALL have end-to-end test scenarios\r\n5.
