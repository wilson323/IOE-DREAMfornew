This module serves as the foundation for various consumption scenarios including dining, subsidies, fixed-amount transactions, and metered services. The system integrates with existing authentication, authorization, and accounting systems while maintaining strict data consistency and security standards.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis consumption module directly supports the IOE-DREAM platform's core business objectives by providing:\r\n\r\n- **Unified Consumption Interface**: A standardized API that supports multiple consumption patterns across different business units\r\n- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Multi-layered security including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and audit trails\r\n- **Financial Data Integrity**: Advanced data consistency mechanisms ensuring zero financial discrepancies\r\n- **Scalable Architecture**: High-performance processing capable of handling enterprise-level transaction volumes\r\n- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for diverse consumption models with runtime configuration capabilities\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Secure Transaction Processing\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure consumption transaction processing with multiple security layers, so that financial data integrity is maintained and unauthorized access is prevented.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN a consumption request is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate user authentication using Sa-Token\r\n2. WHEN a consumption request is processed THEN the system SHALL perform RAC (Resource-Action-Condition) authorization checks\r\n3. WHEN financial transactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs for all operations\r\n4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with appropriate error codes\r\n5. IF authorization fails THEN the system SHALL log the security event and block the operation\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Data Consistency and Reliability\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a financial controller, I want guaranteed data consistency across distributed environments, so that financial records are accurate and reliable.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN concurrent transactions occur on the same account THEN the system SHALL use distributed locking to prevent conflicts\r\n2. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL implement optimistic locking with version control\r\n3. WHEN transaction processing completes THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity through atomic operations\r\n4. IF a distributed lock cannot be acquired within timeout THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate error handling\r\n5. IF version conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL retry the transaction or notify the user\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Multi-Mode Consumption Processing\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a business user, I want multiple consumption modes (standard, fixed-amount, subsidy), so that different business scenarios can be accommodated with appropriate rules and calculations.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN processing consumption requests THEN the system SHALL support standard, fixed-amount, and subsidy consumption modes\r\n2. WHEN fixed-amount mode is used THEN the system SHALL validate amounts against predefined values and time periods\r\n3. WHEN subsidy mode is used THEN the system SHALL calculate subsidies based on fixed amounts, percentages, or tiered rules\r\n4. WHEN a mode fails to process THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to standard mode with proper logging\r\n5. IF invalid consumption parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL reject the request with specific error messages\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Account Security and Management\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system user, I want robust account security features including payment passwords and consumption limits, so that my account is protected from unauthorized use.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN payment password verification is enabled THEN the system SHALL validate passwords with attempt tracking and lockout mechanisms\r\n2. WHEN consumption limits are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce single-transaction, daily, and monthly limits\r\n3. WHEN suspicious activities are detected THEN the system SHALL perform risk assessment and trigger alerts\r\n4. IF payment attempts exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account with configurable duration\r\n5. IF consumption limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL block the transaction and provide clear notification\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5: High Performance and Scalability\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want high-performance processing capabilities, so that the system can handle enterprise-level transaction volumes without degradation.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN processing concurrent transactions THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-200ms response times for standard operations\r\n2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL utilize optimized indexing for 60-85% performance improvement\r\n3. WHEN processing peak loads THEN the system SHALL maintain throughput of 3x baseline performance\r\n4. IF performance degradation is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and initiate optimization procedures\r\n5. IF resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and queuing mechanisms\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service, manager, and strategy class shall have a single, well-defined purpose\r\n- **Modular Design**: Consumption modes, security features, and data consistency mechanisms shall be isolated and reusable\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between consumption strategies and core engine components\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between controller, service, manager, and DAO layers following the four-tier architecture\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- **Response Time**: All API responses shall complete within 200ms for standard operations\r\n- **Throughput**: System shall support minimum 1000 transactions per second with linear scalability\r\n- **Concurrency**: Support for 1000+ concurrent users without performance degradation\r\n- **Database Optimization**: Utilize Redis caching and database indexing to achieve target performance metrics\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- **Authentication**: Integration with Sa-Token for secure user authentication and session management\r\n- **Authorization**: RAC middleware implementation for fine-grained resource access control\r\n- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive financial data shall be encrypted at rest and in transit\r\n- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logging for all financial transactions with immutable records\r\n- **Penetration Testing**: System shall withstand common security vulnerabilities and attacks\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- **Data Consistency**: 99.9% accuracy rate for financial data across distributed environments\r\n- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automated failover and recovery mechanisms\r\n- **Error Recovery**: Automatic transaction rollback and recovery from system failures\r\n- **Disaster Recovery**: Regular data backup and restore capabilities with recovery time objectives\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- **Intuitive Interface**: RESTful APIs with comprehensive documentation and examples\r\n- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages with appropriate error codes\r\n- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health monitoring and performance metrics\r\n- **Configuration**: Runtime configuration management without system restarts\r\n- **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging and diagnostic tools for troubleshooting",
