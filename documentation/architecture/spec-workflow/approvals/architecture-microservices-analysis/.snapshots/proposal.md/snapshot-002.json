  "content": "# Change: Architecture Analysis for Microservices Transformation\r\n\r\n## Why\r\nCurrent IOE-DREAM platform uses monolithic SmartAdmin v3 architecture with 7 core business modules. Analysis reveals 381 compilation errors, some architectural inconsistencies, and opportunities for microservices transformation to improve scalability, maintainability, and team parallel development capabilities.\r\n\r\n## What Changes\r\n- Comprehensive architecture analysis across all business modules\r\n- Microservices transformation roadmap and strategy\r\n- Service boundary definitions and API contracts\r\n- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies\r\n- Implementation timeline and resource allocation\r\n\r\n**BREAKING**: This change initiates the microservices transformation journey but preserves all existing functionality.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Affected specs: microservices (new), smart-architecture (new)\r\n- Affected code: All business modules (access, consume, attendance, video, hr, device, monitor)\r\n- Affected systems: SmartAdmin v3 framework integration\r\n- Team impact: All development teams will transition to microservices architecture",
