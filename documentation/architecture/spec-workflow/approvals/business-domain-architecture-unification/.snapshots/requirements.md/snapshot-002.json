  "content": "# Business Domain Architecture Unification Requirements\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis specification addresses critical architecture violations discovered in the IOE-DREAM project where business domain boundaries are severely compromised. The current module structure contains duplicate domains, unclear responsibilities, and violations of the single responsibility principle that severely impact code maintainability and development efficiency.\r\n\r\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\r\n- Duplicate access control domains (`access/` and `smart/access/`)\r\n- Overly broad `smart/` domain containing multiple independent business areas\r\n- Scattered device management logic across multiple domains\r\n- Inconsistent domain naming conventions\r\n- Violation of repowiki single responsibility principles\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis architectural refactoring directly supports the IOE-DREAM project's goal of providing a \"高性能、安全可靠、易于扩展的管理系统开发框架\" by:\r\n\r\n- **Enhancing Maintainability**: Clear domain boundaries make code easier to understand and modify\r\n- **Improving Scalability**: Well-structured domains support future feature additions\r\n- **Reducing Technical Debt**: Eliminating architectural violations prevents future maintenance issues\r\n- **Ensuring Consistency**: Unified domain structure follows repowiki standards\r\n- **Facilitating Team Development**: Clear domain ownership improves parallel development efficiency\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Eliminate Domain Duplication\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear single source of truth for each business domain, so that I can quickly locate and modify related functionality without confusion.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN examining the access control domain THEN the system SHALL have exactly one access domain\r\n2. WHEN searching for device management THEN the system SHALL provide a single, coherent device domain\r\n3. IF duplicate domains are identified THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into unified domains\r\n4. WHEN domain consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure no business functionality is lost\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Establish Clear Domain Boundaries\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined domain responsibilities, so that I can understand which domain contains specific business logic.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN analyzing the smart domain THEN the system SHALL break it into focused, single-responsibility domains\r\n2. WHEN defining domain boundaries THEN the system SHALL ensure each domain has a clear business purpose\r\n3. WHEN domains are restructured THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality\r\n4. WHEN domain responsibilities are assigned THEN the system SHALL follow repowiki single responsibility principles\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Unify Domain Naming Conventions\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent domain naming across the project, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase structure.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN reviewing domain names THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent naming patterns\r\n2. WHEN renaming domains THEN the system SHALL update all corresponding package names and imports\r\n3. WHEN domain structure changes THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for APIs\r\n4. WHEN naming conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL resolve them through clear domain ownership rules\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Preserve All Business Functionality\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system user, I want all existing business functionality to continue working after domain restructuring, so that my daily operations are not disrupted.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN domains are restructured THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing APIs remain functional\r\n2. WHEN business logic is moved THEN the system SHALL maintain all current feature capabilities\r\n3. WHEN package structures change THEN the system SHALL update all internal references\r\n4. WHEN domain consolidation occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all data models and business rules\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5: Follow repowiki Architecture Standards\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a development team member, I want the refactored domains to strictly follow repowiki standards, so that we maintain architectural consistency.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN creating domain structures THEN the system SHALL follow repowiki domain organization principles\r\n2. WHEN implementing domain boundaries THEN the system SHALL respect repowiki single responsibility guidelines\r\n3. WHEN designing package hierarchies THEN the system SHALL use repowiki naming conventions\r\n4. WHEN refactoring domains THEN the system SHALL maintain repowiki four-layer architecture compliance\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each domain must have one clear business purpose\r\n- **Domain Isolation**: Domains must be independent with minimal cross-dependencies\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between domains\r\n- **Package Organization**: Follow consistent package naming conventions\r\n- **Import Management**: Ensure all package references are updated correctly\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- **Zero Downtime**: Domain refactoring must not break existing functionality\r\n- **API Compatibility**: All existing external APIs must continue to work\r\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid creating unnecessary object relationships\r\n- **Startup Time**: Domain restructuring must not impact application startup performance\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- **Permission Boundaries**: Domain changes must not affect existing security controls\r\n- **Access Control**: Maintain all current authentication and authorization mechanisms\r\n- **Data Integrity**: Ensure no data loss during domain restructuring\r\n- **API Security**: Preserve all existing security annotations and validations\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- **Functionality Preservation**: All current business features must remain functional\r\n- **Data Consistency**: Maintain data integrity across domain boundaries\r\n- **Error Handling**: Ensure all exception handling continues to work properly\r\n- **Logging and Monitoring**: Preserve all existing logging and monitoring capabilities\r\n\r\n### Maintainability\r\n- **Clear Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation to reflect domain changes\r\n- **Code Comments**: Add comments explaining domain ownership and responsibilities\r\n- **Developer Experience**: Ensure the new structure is intuitive for developers\r\n- **Future Extensibility**: Design domains to easily accommodate future features\r\n\r\n## Success Criteria\r\n\r\nThe refactoring is considered successful when:\r\n1. **Domain Duplication Eliminated**: No duplicate business domains exist\r\n2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each domain has a single, well-defined business responsibility\r\n3. **Consistent Naming**: All domain names follow unified conventions\r\n4. **Functionality Preserved**: All existing business features remain operational\r\n5. **repowiki Compliance**: All domains strictly follow repowiki architecture standards\r\n6. **Zero Regression**: No existing functionality is broken or degraded\r\n7. **Developer Clarity**: New developers can easily understand domain ownership and responsibilities",
